            Central American reunification, sometimes called Central Americanism, is the proposed political union of the countries of Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua), which had historically occurred during the existence of the Federal Republic of Central America. It is distinct from the Central American integration process, which is a diplomatic initiative similar to that of the European Union.<br/><br/>Currently the civil organization Movimiento Ciudadano para la Integración Centroamericana (Citizen Movement for Central American Integration) founded in 2014 actively seeks Central American reunification, having chapters in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras (in addition to some local chapters), Nicaragua, and in the Central American diaspora (Australia, Italy, Spain, and the United States), but not in Costa Rica. These chapters are known as "state councils".<br/><br/>The first politician to come up with this idea was General Augusto César Sandino from Nicaragua, and the first political figure in modern times to propose a unification of Central America, including Panama, is President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Attempts to restore the Federal Republic of Central America have existed since its dissolution. One of the best known cases was when the liberal Guatemalan President Justo Rufino Barrios, with the support of Honduras and the United States, tried to re-establish the Central American Federation in the so-called Intentona de Barrios, but that ended with his death in the Battle of Chalchuapa.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, it was mainly leftist forces that would propose the reunification of Central America into a single political unit. In 1925, the Central American Socialist Party was founded in Guatemala by Farabundo Martí and other Salvadorans in exile, and would later also operate as the Central American Communist Party. In the 1970s, the Central American Workers' Revolutionary Party, particularly active in El Salvador and Honduras, would emerge.
