            Hell Town is the name for a Lenape (or Delaware) Native-American village located on Clear Creek near the abandoned town of Newville, in the U.S. state of Ohio. The site is on a high hill just north of the junction of Clear Creek and the Black Fork of the Mohican River.<br/><br/>After the signing of the Treaty of Easton in 1758, the Lenape were required to move west out of their native lands (in Delaware, New Jersey, eastern New York, and eastern Pennsylvania) into what is today known as Ohio. The village had originally been settled by Native Americans of the Mingo (a tribe belonging to the Eastern Algonquian group). But the Mingo abandoned the site around 1755. The Lenape re-founded the settlement in the 1770s. One source says the resettlement came in 1770, while another says it was in 1776. According to the Lenape, the village was called Clear Town, after the clear stream which ran nearby. However, when the Lenape learned that the German word for "clear" was "hell," they renamed their village Hell Town. The site was abandoned in 1782 because of repeated clashes with Colonial American troops and settlers, angry with the Lenape because some members of the tribe had sided with the British during the American Revolution.
