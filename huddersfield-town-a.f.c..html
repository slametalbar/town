            Huddersfield Town Association Football Club is a professional association football club based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England. They compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. <br/><br/>Huddersfield Town were founded on 15 August 1908. They competed in the North Eastern League and Midland League, before gaining admittance to the Football League in 1910. They were promoted out of the Second Division in 1919–20 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1922, having been beaten finalists in 1920. Under the management of Herbert Chapman, Huddersfield were crowned league champions in three successive seasons: 1923–24, 1924–25 and 1925–26. They played on the losing side in three more FA Cup finals: 1928, 1930 and 1938. They were relegated from the First Division after 32 years in 1952, though secured an immediate promotion the following season. Relegated again in 1956, they won the Second Division title at the end of the 1969–70 season, though were relegated three times in four years by 1975.<br/><br/>Huddersfield won the Fourth Division in 1979–80 and were promoted from the Third Division in 1982–83.
