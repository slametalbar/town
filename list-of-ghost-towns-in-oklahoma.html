            The U.S. state of Oklahoma has an estimated two thousand ghost towns. These towns began for a number of reasons, often as liquor towns, boomtowns, or mining towns, with some pre-dating statehood. The population and activity later declined in these locations due to the exhaustion of natural resources, manmade or natural disasters, urbanization, the creation of a water source, or after being bypassed by highways and interstates.<br/><br/>These places vary in their current states with some having completely disappeared while others still have small communities. A small number have also gained notability for other reasons, such as being part of the Tar Creek Superfund Site, for existing in an unusual location, or for crimes. The earliest known ghost town in the state was said to have been one by 1839 while the latest were evacuated in 2010.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Oklahoma is a U.S. state in the South Central region of the United States. It has the nation's twenty-eighth largest population and ranks twentieth in terms of land area in the United States. There are an estimated two thousand ghost towns within the state. Many of these sites emerged quickly for various reasons.
