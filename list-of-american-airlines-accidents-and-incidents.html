            As of January 2025, American Airlines has had almost 60 aircraft hull losses, beginning with the crash of a Ford 5-AT-C Trimotor in August 1931. Of the hull losses, most were propeller-driven aircraft, including three Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft (of which one, the crash in 1959 of Flight 320, resulted in fatalities). The two accidents with the highest fatalities in both the airline's and U.S. aviation history were Flight 191 in 1979 and Flight 587 in 2001.<br/><br/>Out of the 17 hijackings of American Airlines flights, two aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in the September 11 attacks: Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. Flight 11, which is responsible for an estimated 1,700 deaths, is the deadliest air crash in the history of aviation.<br/><br/>Two training flight accidents have occurred in which the crew was killed and six that resulted in no fatalities. Another four jet aircraft have been written off due to incidents while they were parked between flights or while undergoing maintenance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 1930s ==<br/><br/>August 9, 1931: A Ford 5-AT-C Trimotor, registration NC9662, crashed on the bank of the Little Miami River near Cincinnati, Ohio, killing all six on board. The cause was failure and separation of the right-side engine due to a broken hub.<br/><br/>December 31, 1931: A Pilgrim 100A, registration NC708Y, crashed at Brighton, Ohio, after the pilot became disoriented in poor weather, killing four of five on board.
