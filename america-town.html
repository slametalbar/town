            America Town is the second studio album by American pop rock artist Five for Fighting. It was released by Aware Records, a Columbia Records subsidiary, in 2000. It contains two of his most well-known songs, "Easy Tonight" and the Grammy-nominated "Superman (It's Not Easy)". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 1, 2001, and Platinum on October 22, 2004. The album has sold over 966,000 copies in the United States as of November 2009.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background and composition ==<br/><br/>John Ondrasik had been active in the Los Angeles music scene since the 1980s, but did not adopt "Five for Fighting" as his stage name until he signed with EMI Records in 1995. His first album, Message for Albert, came out through EMI in 1997 but EMI's American division closed shortly after Message came out. After EMI's collapse, Ondrasik briefly signed with Island Records, but then "PolyGram, Island's parent company, merged with Universal and he was lost in the shuffle". Ondrasik then signed with Aware and Columbia Records and began working on America Town. After being dropped from two straight record companies, Ondrasik, then in his mid-30s, believed America Town would be his "swan song".
