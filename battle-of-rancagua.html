            The Battle of Rancagua, also known in Chile as the Disaster of Rancagua, occurred on October 1, 1814, to October 2, 1814, when the Spanish Army under the command of Mariano Osorio defeated the Chilean forces led by Bernardo O’Higgins. This put an end to the Chilean Patria Vieja and it was the decisive step of the Spanish military Reconquest of Chile.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>After the signing of the British-broken Treaty of Lircay, that established a comprehensive truce between the patriot government of Chile and the Cortes de Cádiz through the royalist Viceroyalty of Perú, some factions within the pro-independence movement perceived this diplomatic approach to Spain as a treason. On 25 July 1814, the radicals overthrew Supreme Director Francisco de la Lastra and appointed Jose Miguel Carrera as the head of a provisional junta. When the Viceroy of Peru, José Fernando de Abascal, heard about the revolt in Chile, he sent an expedition of Spanish soldiers and royalists to defeat the rebellion. O'Higgins, whose position towards the revolt was unclear, heard about the besieged troops in Rancagua and went with his army of 1,000 patriots, to reinforce Juan Carrera forces at Rancagua. Outnumbered and with barely enough supplies, O'Higgins did not retreat and sealed the fate of his army.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== The Battle ==<br/><br/>The battle occurred on the morning of October 1, 1814, outside the town of Rancagua. The Chilean forces had occupied the town prior to this confrontation and ultimately were surrounded by Osorio’s forces who advanced towards the town. The reason for occupying the town was its strategic importance in the defense of the Chilean capital, Santiago.
