            American Dad! is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Set in the fictional town of Langley Falls, Virginia, the series centers on the eccentric Smith family. The Smith family consists of title character Stan, Francine, Hayley, Steve, Roger (an alien whom Stan has rescued from government capture and harbors in the family's attic), Jeff Fischer (Hayley's boyfriend, now husband), Klaus (the family's pet who is really an East German man trapped by the CIA in a fish's body) and Rogu (Roger's son that was formerly a tumor). The series' eleventh season was its final season to air on Fox; the show moved to the cable network TBS beginning with the twelfth season, and would continue airing new episodes on the network until the end of its twenty-first season.<br/><br/>On December 16, 2021, the series was renewed for its twentieth and twenty-first seasons. The twentieth season premiered on March 27, 2023. The 21st season premiered on October 28, 2024. On March 21, 2025, it was announced that the show would no longer air new episodes on TBS once the current season concluded on March 24, 2025. The show is now set to return to its original network, Fox and has been renewed for a 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th seasons.
