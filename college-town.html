            A college town or university town is a town or city whose character is dominated by a college or university and their associated culture, often characterised by the student population making up 20 percent of the population of the community, but not including communities that are parts of larger urban areas (often termed student quarters). The university may be large, or there may be several smaller institutions such as liberal arts colleges clustered, or the residential population may be small, but college towns in all cases are so dubbed because the presence of the educational institution(s) pervades economic and social life. Many local residents may be employed by the university—which may be the largest employer in the community—many businesses cater primarily to the university, and the student population may outnumber the local population.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Europe, a university town is generally characterised by having an old university. The economy of the city is closely related with the university activity and highly supported by the entire university structure, which may include university hospitals and clinics, printing houses, libraries, laboratories, business incubators, student rooms, dining halls, students' unions, student societies, and academic festivities. Moreover, the history of the city is often intertwined with that of the university. Many European university towns have not merely been important places of science and education, but also centres of political, cultural and social influence throughout the centuries. In university towns such as Oxford, Cambridge, St Andrews and Durham, the town centre is dominated both physically and functionally by the university, with the result that the town has become identified with the university. While in many historical university towns, the town has grown up around the university, Durham is an example of a university town where the university has 'colonised' the town centre. <br/><br/>Besides a highly educated and largely transient population, a stereotypical college town often has many people in non-traditional lifestyles and subcultures and with a high tolerance for unconventionality in general, and has a very active musical or cultural scene.
