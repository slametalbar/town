            Lucky Town is the tenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen. The album was released on March 27, 1992, the same day as Springsteen's ninth studio album Human Touch. Lucky Town peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, with lead single "Better Days" (double A-side single with Human Touch's title track) peaking at number one on the US Mainstream Rock and number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Lucky Town has since been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for over one million copies sold in the US.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Springsteen was working on Human Touch, which he intended to release sometime in 1990, but the project took him longer than he thought. He shelved the project in early 1991 and came back to it in September of the same year.  Intending to record one more song for the album ("Living Proof"), he ended up with 10 new songs. Once he completed the sessions, he decided to put the 10 new songs on a separate album, which became Lucky Town, and to   release it at the same time as Human Touch. While most of the songs from the album have received few performances since the reunion of the E Street Band, "If I Should Fall Behind" was played at every show during the 1999–2000 Reunion Tour and was included in the Live in New York City DVD and CD release.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Themes ==<br/><br/>Compared to Human Touch, Lucky Town has a more stripped down, folk-based sound and is more personal in its songs' lyrics. Human Touch consisted of mostly love songs, while Lucky Town focuses on more specific events in Springsteen's life.
