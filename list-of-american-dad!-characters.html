            This article lists characters from the animated series American Dad!.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Voice cast ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The voice actors are not assembled as a group when performing the lines of their characters; rather, each of the voice actors perform their lines privately. The voice actors have stated that because of their personalities and tendency to goof off when together as a group, they would never get anything completed if they performed their lines collectively.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Appearances ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Main characters ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Stan Smith ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stanford Leonard "Stan" Smith (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the title character on American Dad! who has an exaggeratedly masculine voice and manner about him. Stan is Francine's husband and Hayley and Steve's father. Hayley may or may not be Stan's biological daughter since Francine revealed to have cheated on Stan at a bachelorette party in the episode "The Kidney Stays in the Picture", but Stan regards Hayley as his daughter. As the Smith family breadwinner, Stan is a CIA agent. Early on in the series, Stan was exaggeratedly patriotic and Conservative. His character, however, has progressed over the course of the series from the ultra right-wing it had been.
