            Pawnee ( paw-NEE) is a fictional town located in the state of Indiana in which the NBC comedy series Parks and Recreation is set. Since the show's start in 2009, the city's “colorful” history and inhabitants have been the joke or focal point for many episodes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== History ===<br/><br/>Pawnee's fictional history begins with its founding in 1817, which was very shortly followed by the driving of the Native American Wamapoke tribe from the land. The town is depicted as having an extensive history of racial and misogynistic abuse towards the Wamapoke people, which it celebrates in various murals on the walls at City Hall.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Demographics ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Population ====<br/><br/>Pawnee is depicted as a typical mid-sized city in south central Indiana, located in the fictional "Wamapoke County" about 90 miles from Indianapolis. Dialogue from the show and other officially licensed material suggest a population in the range of 60,000 to a little over 80,000.<br/><br/>Pawnee's twin town is Eagleton, Indiana, a smaller but wealthier adjacent community. Eagleton was founded by Pawnee's richest original settlers, who moved uphill shortly after Pawnee's establishment to found their own town. A mutual dislike between the communities has festered ever since. However, in "The Pawnee-Eagleton Tip Off Classic", due to Eagleton's impending bankruptcy (caused by overspending on luxurious amenities for Eagleton residents), Eagleton is dissolved and incorporated into Pawnee.
