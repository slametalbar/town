            Middle America is a colloquial term for the United States heartland, especially the culturally suburban areas of the United States, typically the lower Midwestern region of the country, which consists of Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, <br/><br/>and downstate Illinois.<br/><br/>Middle America is generally used as both a geographic and cultural label, suggesting a central United States small town or suburb where most people speak with a General American accent, are middle class or upper middle class, religiously Evangelical, Mainline Protestant, or non-denominational Christian, and typically, but not always, European Americans, particularly of Anglo-Saxon Protestant, Ulster Scot, or Germanic descent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== As a geographical label ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Geographically, the label Middle America refers to the territory between the East Coast of the United States (particularly the northeast) and the West Coast. The term has been used in some cases to refer to the inland portions of coastal states, especially if they are rural. Alternately, the term is used to describe the central United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== As a cultural label ==<br/><br/>Middle America is contrasted with the more culturally progressive, urban areas of the country, particularly, those of the East and West Coasts. The conservative values considered typical of Middle America (often called "family values" in American politics) are often called "Middle American values".<br/><br/>The plots of such American films as Sweet Home Alabama and The Judge center on the contrast between big city life and that of a typical "Middle America" small town; in both, a protagonist with a successful big city career is drawn back to an old hometown. Similarly, the protagonist of John Grisham's novel  The Associate leaves a well-paid job at a giant Wall Street law firm and goes to work with his lawyer father in his hometown, York, Pennsylvania. The contrast between "Middle America" and big city America is evident in the life of the fictional superhero Superman – growing up as Superboy in the archetypal Smallville and as an adult moving to the equally archetypal Metropolis.
