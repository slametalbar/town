            The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town is a 1977 American-Japanese musical Easter television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions, using their "Animagic" stop motion animation. The special reunites the writer Romeo Muller, designer Paul Coker Jr., and narrator Fred Astaire from Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, and stars the voices of Skip Hinnant, Bob McFadden, Meg Sargent, James Spies and Allen Swift. It premiered on ABC in the United States on April 6, 1977.<br/><br/>The special includes original songs including two sung by Astaire: "The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town" and "All You Have to Do is Think 'Can Do'".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>S.D. Kluger returns as a train engineer, but still a mailman to answer questions about the Easter Bunny in the children's letters.<br/><br/>The story begins in the small town of Kidville, a community comprising orphaned children (including S.D. Kluger when he was a child) at the foot of Big Rock Mountain. The children enjoy the simple life despite being bothered by Gadzooks the Bear who hates everything to do with the holidays including birthdays.<br/><br/>One Easter morning, the children find an orphaned baby rabbit, raise him as their own, and name him Sunny when they notice how much he likes the warm sun. Now one year old, Sunny makes plans with the children to sell what they make in exchange for what they need, including their eggs, with help from three chickens called the Hendrews Sisters.<br/><br/>Sunny sets off to deliver his eggs.
