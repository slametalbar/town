            Boys Town, officially Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, is a nonprofit based in Boys Town, Nebraska dedicated to caring for children and families.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boys Town was founded on December 12, 1917, as an orphanage for boys. Originally known as "The City of Little Men", the organization was begun by Edward J. Flanagan, a Roman Catholic priest, while he worked in the Diocese of Omaha. Using a loan of $90, he first rented a home at 25th and Dodge streets, in Omaha, to care for five boys. From these beginnings, the City of Little Men developed new juvenile care methods in 20th-century America, emphasizing "social preparation as a model for public boys' homes worldwide". Flanagan is now a candidate for beatification.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1917–1921: Early growth and move to Overlook Farm ===<br/><br/>Boys Town quickly grew from the original five boys living in a home in downtown Omaha in 1917 to more than 100 boys by early 1918. The increase required a relocation in 1919 to South Omaha. Flanagan had been contending with criticism about having kids of different races, religions, nationalities, and backgrounds all living together under the same roof. Mounting societal tensions and the need for even more space led to Flanagan’s 1921 decision to relocate Boys Town to Overlook Farm.
