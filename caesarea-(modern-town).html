            Caesarea ( SE(E)Z-ə-REE-ə, SESS-; Arabic: قيساريّة, Hebrew: קֵיסָרְיָה, romanized: Qēsarya, pronounced [keiˈsaʁja]), also transliterated as Keisarya or Qaysaria, is an affluent resort town in north-central Israel, which was named after the ancient city of Caesarea Maritima situated 1–2 kilometres (0.62–1.24 mi) to the south in the adjacent Caesarea National Park.<br/><br/>Located midway between Tel Aviv and Haifa on the coastal plain near the city of Hadera, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hof HaCarmel Regional Council. With a population of 5,997, it is the only Israeli locality managed by a private organization, the Caesarea Development Corporation, and also one of the most populous localities not recognized as a local council.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Caesarea Maritima ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The modern town is named after the nearby ancient city of Caesarea Maritima, built by Herod the Great about 25–13 BCE as a major port. It served as an administrative center of the province of Syria and Palestine which came under the Roman Empire rule, and later as the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina Prima. During the Muslim rule of the Levant in the 7th century, the city degraded to a small village after the provincial capital was moved to Ramla and had an Arab majority until Crusader conquest. Under the Crusaders it became once again a major port and a fortified city. It was diminished after the Mamluk rule. In 1884, Herzegovinian Muslim immigrants who left Austria-Hungary were settled there by the Ottoman authorities. At the time, Caesarea was a semi-demolished archaeological site.
