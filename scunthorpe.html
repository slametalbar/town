            Scunthorpe () is an industrial town in Lincolnshire, England, and the county's third most populous settlement after Lincoln and Grimsby, with a population of 81,286 in 2021. It is the administrative centre and largest settlement of the North Lincolnshire district. Scunthorpe lies north of Lincoln and is between Grimsby to the east and Doncaster to the west, while Hull is to the north-east via the Humber Bridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Scunthorpe as a town came into existence due to the exploitation of the local ironstone which began in 1859; iron production commenced in 1864, steel smelting in 1891.<br/><br/>Scunthorpe's population grew from 1,245 in 1851 to 11,167 in 1901 and 45,840 in 1941. The boundaries of Scunthorpe expanded to include the former villages of Bottesford, Frodingham, Crosby, Brumby and Ashby. Scunthorpe became an urban district in 1891, merged as 'Scunthorpe, Brumby and Frodingham Urban District' in 1919, and became a municipal borough in 1936. Scunthorpe was originally dominated, socially, politically and culturally, by Rowland Winn, the most significant landowner in the district. By the First World War local working class culture, drawing on trade unions and the Labour Party had emerged to challenge the Conservative Party's hegemony.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Etymology ===<br/><br/>The town appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Escumesthorpe, which is from the Old Norse Skumasþorp meaning "Skuma's homestead", a site which is believed to be in the town centre, close to Market Hill.
