            Cum Town is a comedy podcast that was hosted by New York City-based comedians Nick Mullen, Stavros Halkias, and Adam Friedland, and produced between 2016 and 2022. During its run, it was consistently one of the most popular podcasts on Patreon and concluded as one of the top 25 comedy podcasts on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. In July 2022, it was succeeded by Mullen and Friedland's spin-off podcast and interview show The Adam Friedland Show.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 2016, Cum Town was created by Mullen, the primary host and producer of the show. Halkias was the first co-host; Friedland became a second co-host, starting as a frequent guest and first appearing in the show's second episode.<br/><br/>The podcast concluded in June 2022 after months of the hosts suggesting its end as well as their renewed interest in stand-up comedy, particularly Halkias, who released his debut comedy special that month. On June 25, 2022, Halkias announced that he was no longer part of Cum Town. Subsequently, Mullen and Friedland revealed their plan for a spin-off podcast—The Adam Friedland Show—to be hosted by Friedland and produced by Mullen.<br/><br/>On March 3, 2025, an episode titled Cum Town Farewell was uploaded to the podcast's Patreon account, with its description having described the release as "...the final episode of Cum Town," accompanying a larger expression of gratitude for fans of the podcast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Content ==<br/><br/>Cum Town episodes were typically 60 minutes long and consisted of improvised comedy blended with casual unscripted conversation.
