            This is a list of cities and towns in Greenland as of 1 January 2024. The term 'city' is used loosely for any populated area in Greenland, given that the most populated place is Nuuk, the capital, with 19,900 inhabitants, amounting to about 35% of the total population. In Greenland, two kinds of settled areas are distinguished: illoqarfik (Greenlandic for 'town'; by in Danish) and nunaqarfik (Greenlandic for 'settlement'; bygd in Danish). The difference between the two decreased since the new administrative units were introduced in 2009, with the influence of previous municipality centres decreasing. Traditionally, the seat of each municipality was considered a by, whereas every other settlement in a municipality was a bygd. A bygd could have anything from one to about five hundred inhabitants. Many places have Danish names in addition to the Greenlandic names. The Danish name, when applicable, is shown.<br/><br/>As of 1 January 2024 the resident population of Greenland was estimated at 56,699, an increase of 90 (0.2%) compared to the corresponding figure the previous year.
