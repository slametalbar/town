<h1>Town Hall Party</h1>
            
            Town Hall Party was an American country music and rockabilly entertainment program originating in Southern California.  It was initially broadcast on radio in 1951 and then on television beginning in 1953.<br/><br/>The first radio broadcast was in Autumn 1951 by stations KXLA-AM in Pasadena, California and  KFI-AM in Los Angeles, California<br/><br/>On television, the show was broadcast by KTTV-TV in Los Angeles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Founding and synopsis ==<br/><br/>Promoter William B. Wagnon, Jr., had been booking such acts as Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys in ballrooms between Bakersfield and Sacramento for several years when he decided to extend his operations to Los Angeles. Burt "Foreman" Phillips, himself a bandleader had been promoting country and Western barn dance programs at the old Town Hall building, situated at 400 South Long Beach Boulevard in Compton, near Long Beach. Wagnon acquired Phillips' lease and commenced promoting a combined dance-and-show, featuring any and all country &amp; western recording artists working in the area and available on Saturday nights. An estimated 3,000 patrons could be accommodated in the Town Hall Ballroom.<br/><br/>Wagnon instructed the performers to play only music which could be danced to, and to keep individual songs short and plentiful, in order to satisfy everyone's tastes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== NBC radio broadcasts ==<br/><br/>A Friday night radio version of Town Hall Party was heard on KXLA, and Wagnon approached KFI with a proposal for a Saturday night broadcast. The latter was carried by portions of the NBC Radio network.
