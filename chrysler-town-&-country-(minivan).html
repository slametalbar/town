            The Chrysler Town &amp; Country is a minivan manufactured and marketed by Chrysler starting from the 1990 until the 2016 model year. It was the third Chrysler minivan model introduced in North America. The Town &amp; Country adopted its nameplate from the flagship Chrysler station wagon line, adopting its exterior woodgrain trim as a design feature for several generations.   <br/><br/>Marketed as the flagship of the Chrysler minivan line, five generations of the Town &amp; Country were slotted above the extended-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager.  For 2017, Chrysler retired the nameplate, with sixth-generation Chrysler-division minivans becoming the Chrysler Pacifica.  After the 2016 model year, Chrysler marked the sale of its 12 millionth minivan (under all three nameplates). Produced almost continuously for 75 years (except during World War II and 1989), the Town &amp; Country nameplate is the longest-produced Chrysler; its longevity is second only to the Chevrolet Suburban in worldwide automotive history.    <br/><br/>Chrysler assembled the first three generations of the model line in its Saint Louis Assembly facility (Fenton, Missouri). The fourth and fifth-generation Town &amp; Country were produced by Chrysler Canada by Windsor Assembly (Windsor, Ontario).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== First generation (1990) ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan was introduced as a minivan in the spring of 1989 as an early 1990 model.
