            Modern Woodmen of America (MWA) is an American fraternal benefit society, which sells various investments and insurance products, with membership over 750,000 as of 2017. Total assets reached US$17.5 Billion billion in 2022, making it one of the largest such organization by assets. Though it shares the same founder, it is not affiliated financially in any way with another, similarly styled fraternal benefit society, WoodmenLife, and despite the name "Modern" is actually older than its counterpart.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Modern Woodmen of America was founded by Joseph Cullen Root on January 5, 1883, in Lyons, Iowa. He had operated a number of businesses, including a mercantile establishment, a grain elevator and two flour mills, sold insurance and real estate, taught bookkeeping classes, managed a lecture bureau, and practiced law. Root was a member of several fraternal societies throughout the years. He wanted to create an organization that would protect families following the death of a breadwinner.<br/><br/>During a Sunday sermon, Root heard the pastor tell a parable about pioneer woodmen clearing away forests to build homes, communities and security for their families. He adopted the term "woodmen" for his organization. To complete the name, he added "modern" to reflect the need to stay current and change with the times, and "of America" to symbolize patriotism.
