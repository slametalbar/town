            "Try That in a Small Town" is a song written by Kelley Lovelace, Neil Thrasher, Tully Kennedy, and Kurt Allison, and recorded by American country music singer Jason Aldean. It was released to country radio in May 2023 as the lead single to Aldean's eleventh studio album Highway Desperado, released in November 2023.<br/><br/>The song was the subject of widespread controversy and media attention following the release of its music video in July 2023, with accusations that the song was a coded endorsement of lynching, which both Aldean and the video's producers have denied. Four days after the video's release, the television network CMT withdrew it from its rotation. After the subsequent extensive media coverage, "Try That in a Small Town" had a surge in popularity.<br/><br/>The track reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, Aldean's first on that chart to date, and in late July experienced the biggest sales week for a country song in over 10 years. It also reached number nine in Canada and number five in the Philippines. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Content ==<br/><br/>"Try That in a Small Town" contrasts rural and urban lifestyles. It asserts that behavior such as flag burning, carjacking, or protests and attacks toward police officers will face stronger consequences in a rural setting than an urban one, stating, "try that in a small town, see how far ya make it down the road" and "if you're looking for a fight, try that in a small town". In the second verse, Aldean sings about gun rights and not wanting his own to be confiscated.
