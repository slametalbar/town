            Petralia Sottana (Sicilian: Pitralìa Suttana) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Palermo, in the island of Sicily, Southern Italy. The main characters in Emanuele Crialese's 2006 film of Sicilian immigration to America, Nuovomondo, come from the town of Petralia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The first traces of human settlement date back to the 4th/3rd millennium BC (Neolithic and Eneolithic periods) as evidenced by the archaeological finds in the nearby Grotta del Vecchiuzzo. In much closer times there must have been an indigenous settlement, strongly influenced by the nearby Greek colony of Imera, in whose excavations a bronze coin was found, the Petrinon which bears the name of the city of Petra. That Petra corresponds to modern Petralia is suggested by the name and proximity to Imera.<br/><br/>During the First Punic War the town expelled their Carthaginian garrison and surrendered to the Romans after the fall of Panormus to the Romans after which 10,000 inhabitants of Panormus were sold into slavery. In the 3rd century BC, with the Roman conquest, Petra became a "decumanus" city and a center of some importance as a military garrison and agricultural market, as evidenced by several writings of the time (among others Cicero in the "Verrine" and Diodorus Siculus) and by a few archaeological finds. The town then suffered the fate of the rest of the island, suffering the barbarian invasions first and the subsequent Byzantine reconquest.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>The Madonie Mountains cover the commune. Petralia Sottana hosts the headquarters of the Madonie Regional Natural Park, in which is included a significant amount of its municipal territory.
