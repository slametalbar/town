            A company town is a place where all or most of the stores and housing in the town are owned by the same company that is also the main employer. Company towns are often planned with a suite of amenities such as stores, houses of worship, schools, markets, and recreation facilities.<br/><br/>Some company towns were established to improve living conditions for workers, but many have been regarded as controlling and/or exploitative. Others were not planned, such as Summit Hill, Pennsylvania, United States, one of the oldest, which began as a Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company mining camp and mine site nine miles (14 km) from the nearest outside road.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Traditional settings for company towns were where extractive industries – coal, metal mines, lumber – had established a monopoly franchise. Dam sites and war-industry camps founded other company towns. Since company stores often had a monopoly in company towns, it was frequently possible to pay in scrip through a truck system. However, not all company towns engaged in this particular practice.<br/><br/>Typically, a company town is isolated from neighboring towns and centered on a large production factory, such as a lumber or steel mill or an automobile plant. The citizens of the town either work in the factory, work in one of the smaller businesses, or are family members of someone who does.
