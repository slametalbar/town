            Thai Town (Thai: ไทยทาวน์) is a neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California.  In 2008, it was one of the five Asian Pacific Islander neighborhoods in the city—along with Chinatown, Little Tokyo,  Historic Filipinotown, and Koreatown—that received federal recognition as a Preserve America neighborhood. It is the only officially recognized Thai Town in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously on October 27, 1999, to designate the neighborhood as "Thai Town," the first place in the United States with that name. The designation was proposed by Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who said the move would bring neighborhood pride, economic development and promotion of tourism to the area. At that time, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) was instructed to install signage to identify Thai Town.<br/><br/>It was significant to Goldberg that the staff of the Thai Community Development Center includes other Asians, Latinos and whites, all intent on improving the East Hollywood business community in general. "They're already calling Thai Town the 77th province," said Thai Chamber of Commerce President Niphun Rojanasopondist, referring to the 76 provinces that made up Thailand at the time.<br/><br/>In 2000, the center won  a $15,000 Department of Public Works matching grant  to create a garden and to bring from Thailand four golden statues of kinnari (mythical creatures who are half angel, half bird) to mark Thai Town's borders.<br/><br/>In 2008, the Thai Community Development Center expanded its partnership with the four Asian Pacific Islander communities in Los Angeles to pursue a national designation by the White House of all five API towns as a Preserve America Neighborhood.
