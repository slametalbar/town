            Pain Killer is the sixth studio album by American country music group Little Big Town. It was released on October 21, 2014, through Capitol Nashville. Little Big Town co-wrote eight of the album's thirteen tracks. Pain Killer was produced by Jay Joyce.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Critical reception ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pain Killer received widespread critical acclaim. In giving the album a rating of "B+", Bob Paxman of Country Weekly praised the group's vocal harmonies and the songwriting, particularly the songs written by Lori McKenna, but criticized the "overly cluttered" production on some tracks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album as "the rarest thing in contemporary country, a record with an expansive world-view delivered with a kinetic kick and infallible melodies, a record that gives no indication of where it's going upon first listen but remains compelling upon further spins". The album has a score of 83 on Metacritic indicating “universal acclaim.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Accolades ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Commercial performance ==<br/><br/>The album debuted at number seven on Billboard 200 and number three on Top Country Albums chart, selling 42,000 copies in its first week. As of January 2017, the album has sold 511,300 copies in the United States. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over a million units.
