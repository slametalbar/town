            America Chavez is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Joe Casey and artist Nick Dragotta, the character first appeared in Vengeance #1 (September 2011). Chavez is a lesbian superhero of Latin-American origin. She has assumed the mantle of Miss America from the superheroine Madeline Joyce. She has also been a member of the A-Force, the Ultimates, and the Young Avengers at various points in her history. <br/><br/>The character was initially depicted as originating from the Utopian Parallel, a dimension outside time and space. She was a Starling of the Fuertona species, an alien race typically possessing supernatural abilities. Her origin was later retconned, revealing that she was born on Earth to scientists attempting to cure her of a disease. The Utopian Parallel was redefined as a medical facility where she underwent experimentation, which ultimately led to the development of her powers. Chavez's signature power is the creation of star-shaped portals that enable her to travel across space and time.
