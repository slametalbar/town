            The Town Clock, also sometimes called the Old Town Clock or Citadel Clock Tower, is a clock tower located at Fort George in the urban core of Halifax, the capital city of Nova Scotia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the commander-in-chief of the military forces of British North America, is credited with the idea of a clock for the British Army and Royal Navy garrison at Halifax, to resolve tardiness in the garrison. He arranged for a turret clock to be manufactured before his return to England in 1800.<br/><br/>The clock tower is a three-tiered (three storey), irregular octagon tower built atop a one-storey white clapboard building of classic Palladian proportions.  It was erected on the east slope of Citadel Hill facing Barrack (now Brunswick) Street. The clock face is 4-sided, displaying Roman numerals. As with most clocks the "4" is shown as IIII for aesthetic symmetry and not as IV.<br/><br/>The clock mechanism was constructed by the "House of Vulliamy", respected Royal Clockmakers based in London.  It is driven by three weights, gears, and a 13-foot pendulum with the mechanism being housed in a cast iron frame located in the "clock room", immediately below the belfry.  Its bell strikes hourly and quarterly and the durability of the mechanism (which dates to the original installation) is attributed to its slow movement.<br/><br/>The Town Clock began keeping time for the garrison on October 20, 1803.
