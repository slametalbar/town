            The Town of Madison was located in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. The town ceased to exist on October 31, 2022. Its final population was 6,236 at the 2020 United States census. The majority of the town's territory was situated along the Madison Beltline Highway, comprising several neighborhoods situated between the south side of the city of Madison, and the north side of the city of Fitchburg. The town also had territory on the north side of Madison near the border with Maple Bluff, as well as a few lots on the west side of Madison near Whitney Way. The Dane County Expo Center and Alliant Energy Center were situated within the Town of Madison. Despite its status as an unincorporated community, the Town of Madison provided a variety of services to its residents which typically would only be found in incorporated cities and villages, including trash and recycling services, police, fire and emergency medical services; sewer and water utilities; and three public parks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The original Town of Madison encompassed approximately 36 square miles (93 km2), and was organized on February 2, 1846. In 1856 the Wisconsin Legislature chartered the city of Madison, leaving the remainder as the town. Most of this land was gradually incorporated into various municipalities, especially the City of Madison, leaving the town as a collection of discontinuous areas subject to annexation.
