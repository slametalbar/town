            Fayetteville is a town in and the county seat of Fayette County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 2,887 at the 2020 census.<br/><br/>Fayetteville lies adjacent to the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve and is directly south of the New River Gorge Bridge. Fayetteville was listed as one of the 2006 "Top 10 Coolest Small Towns in America" by Budget Travel Magazine, and as "Best River Town 2013" by Blue Ridge Outdoors magazine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fayetteville was founded as Vandalia by Abraham Vandall, a Revolutionary War veteran and local farmer, on farmland that Vandall owned. In 1837, the county seat of government was moved from New Haven in the Mountain Cove District to Vandalia. Later, the town's name was changed to Fayetteville after the Revolutionary War hero, Marquis de Lafayette who toured the US in 1824–25.<br/><br/>During the Civil War, the majority of the people in Fayetteville were in sympathy with the Confederacy. With neighboring counties being predominantly Unionist, however, Fayetteville changed hands several times during the war and was partially destroyed during the fighting.<br/><br/>In 1897, the Fayette County Courthouse was completed on part of the original Vandall farm and was a remarkable example of the Romanesque Revival architectural style.
