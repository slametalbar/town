            Blue Highways is an autobiographical travel book, published in 1982, by William Least Heat-Moon, born William Trogdon.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Summary ==<br/><br/>In 1978, after separating from his wife and losing his job as a teacher, Heat-Moon, 38 at the time, took an extended road trip in a circular route around the United States, sticking to only the "Blue Highways". He had coined the term to refer to small, forgotten, out-of-the-way roads connecting rural America, which were drawn in blue on the Rand McNally road atlases of the time.<br/><br/>He outfitted his van with a bunk, a camping stove, a portable toilet and a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass and John Neihardt's Black Elk Speaks.  Referring to the Native American resurrection ritual, he named the van "Ghost Dancing", and embarked on a three-month soul-searching tour of the United States, wandering from small town to small town, stopping often at towns with interesting names. The book chronicles the 13,000-mile journey and the people he meets along the way, as he steers clear of cities and interstates, avoiding fast food and exploring local American culture.<br/><br/>Stories that arose from Least Heat-Moon's research as well as historical facts are included about each area visited, as well as conversations with characters such as a Seventh-day Adventist evangelist hitchhiker, a teenage runaway, a boat builder, a monk, an Appalachian log cabin restorer, a rural Nevada prostitute, fishermen, a Hopi Native American medical student, owners of Western saloons and remote country stores, a maple syrup farmer, and Chesapeake Bay island dwellers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Reception ==<br/><br/>Blue Highways was on the New York Times bestseller list for 42 weeks in 1982–83.<br/><br/>Robert Penn Warren called the book "a masterpiece," writing that "[Least Heat-Moon] makes America seem new, in a very special way, and its people new."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cultural impact ==<br/><br/>Blue Highways Revisited: Written and photographed by Edgar I. Ailor III, and Edgar I. Ailor IV, Blue Highways Revisited is a 30-year follow-up to Heat-Moon's original book. The Ailors re-travel the routes of Heat-Moon and seek out the sites he visited, as well as the people he interacted with along the way.
