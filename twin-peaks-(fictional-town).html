            Twin Peaks, Washington is a fictional town that serves as the primary setting of the television series Twin Peaks, created by Mark Frost and David Lynch, and the associated films Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) and Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces (shot 1991, released 2014). Although the series states that the town is "five miles south of the Canadian border, and twelve miles west of the [Washington-Idaho] state line" (i.e., within the Salmo-Priest Wilderness), most of the show's stock exterior footage was shot in the neighboring Washington towns of Snoqualmie, North Bend, and Fall City, around 25-30 miles from Seattle.<br/><br/>Lynch and Frost started their location search in Snoqualmie on the recommendation of a friend of Frost. In the area, they found all of the locations that they had written into the pilot episode. Common locations within the series originally filmed in the Snoqualmie area include the characters' various homes, the Sheriff's Department, the Double R Diner, The Great Northern Hotel, Big Ed's Gas Farm, and Twin Peaks High School. In addition, two supernatural locations are accessible through portals in the forests surrounding Twin Peaks: The Black Lodge and The White Lodge.<br/><br/>Although the pilot, Fire Walk with Me, The Missing Pieces, and many scenes in season 3 of the television series (2017) were shot on location in Washington state, for convenience, much of the filming for seasons 1 and 2 took place in the Los Angeles area. Many exterior scenes were filmed in wooded areas of Malibu, California, and most of the interior scenes were shot on standing sets in a San Fernando Valley warehouse.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Double R Diner ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the series, the Double R Diner is owned and managed by Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton). Norma employs two waitresses: Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick) and Heidi (Andrea Hays).
