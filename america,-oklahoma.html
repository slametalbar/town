            America is a ghost town in southeastern McCurtain County, Oklahoma, United States.  It was located 7 miles southeast of Haworth.  The town was named after America Stewart, wife of Tom Stewart, a local resident.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>America grew around a sawmill built by William Spencer and his three brothers in 1907. The Spencer family built 40 houses to lease to sawmill workers,  and by 1910 there were 200 people living in America. In 1911, after all the timber had been cut, Spencer opened a cotton gin and general store and became a cotton buyer.  Cotton grown on the cleared land was shipped out by the Arkansas and Choctaw Railway (a predecessor of the Frisco) that ran through the town.  After cotton production declined in the 1920s, most residents moved out. The cotton gin closed in 1933, around the time when the Great Depression was at its worst.  Buck and Blanche Barrow, associates of Bonnie &amp; Clyde were married in America on July 3, 1931.
