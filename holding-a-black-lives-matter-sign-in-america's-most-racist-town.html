            "Holding a Black Lives Matter Sign in America's Most Racist Town" is a YouTube video by American filmmaker Rob Bliss, published on July 27, 2020. The video consists of Bliss holding a sign reading "Black Lives Matter" in Harrison, Arkansas, a town that has been dubbed "America's Most Racist Town" due to its connections to white pride riots and the headquarters of the white supremacist terrorist hate group the Ku Klux Klan. During the video, multiple white passersby drive by and shout racist obscenities. <br/><br/>"Holding a Black Lives Matter Sign in America's Most Racist Town" was filmed from July 9–11 in Harrison using a GoPro. The video's release was notable for being amongst protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. "Holding a Black Lives Matter Sign in America's Most Racist Town" received criticism from Harrison officials, including mayor Jerry Jackson.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Prior to "Holding a Black Lives Matter Sign in America's Most Racist Town", Bliss' previous videos were notable for touching on other social issues, including 2014's "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman", a video where actress Shoshana Roberts walks for ten hours through all areas of Manhattan compiling the frequent catcalling that she experienced. The video spawned numerous parodies, including a Funny or Die satire where the woman is replaced with a man, and another where the woman is replaced with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un. The video also inspired numerous serious variations, including one where the woman in question is wearing a hijab.<br/><br/>Bliss also organized a stunt where 100 men were promised to go on a Tinder date with a woman, only to be led to a crowded club populated by the other men.
